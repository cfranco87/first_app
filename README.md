Roll Dice App

I Created my first app, using the tutorial Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller to learn the programming language. To improve on this exercise I’ve decide to make changes.

Originally used ‘package: flutter drop shadow’ effect but it affected the background image and decided to try something else.
